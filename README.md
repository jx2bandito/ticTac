# Tic Tac Toe<br />


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Tic Tac Toe game that allows the user to play with another person, or with 3 different AI.
I took inspiration from The Terminator for the design. This was my largest project at the time of its creation. I took a fairly imperative approach since I was figuring everything out step by step. Still, it was a very fun project that let me practice a little bit of everything - DOM manipulation, CSS, objects, and even my imagination.
